title: What is StackKit
description: Understand what StackKit is and what it does
---

StackKit is a **production-ready project generator and modular CLI** for building full-stack applications. It is **not a framework**—instead, it helps you bootstrap projects with popular frameworks and add features incrementally.

## When to use StackKit

- Starting a new full-stack project with best practices pre-configured
- Adding authentication or database support to an existing project
- Prototyping with modern stacks without manual setup

## Key Features

- **Project Generation**: Create complete projects with frameworks like Next.js, Express, or React
- **Modular CLI**: Add features (auth, database) to any existing project
- **Production-Ready**: Includes TypeScript, testing, linting, and deployment configs
- **Framework Agnostic**: Supports multiple stacks with compatibility checks

## How it works

StackKit combines **templates** (base project structures) with **modules** (feature add-ons) to generate or enhance your codebase. It handles dependencies, file generation, and environment setup automatically.
